# Customer-churn-prediction
Churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses to retain their customers and maintain profitability. Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in predicting customer churn in various industries. In this project,  a comparative study of several machine learning algorithms applied to churn prediction in the telecommunications industry. Starts by describing the dataset used in this study, which contains customer information and their churn status and then preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Next,  various machine learning algorithms, including  logistic regression, neural network, random forests,xgboost and support vector machines are applied foolowed by evaluating  the performance of these algorithms using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve also investigate the impact of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning on the performance of the machine learning algorithms ,results suggest that feature selection can significantly improve the performance of some algorithms, while hyperparameter tuning can further enhance the performance of others.
In conclusion, , the combination of machine learning algorithms with hot rod encoding for churn prediction provides organisations with an effective and data-driven method to proactively identify consumers who are at danger of churning and optimise their strategy for customer retention. Businesses are able to gain valuable insights, make informed decisions, and take timely actions to retain customers by leveraging the predictive power of machine learning algorithms and the interpretability of hot rod encoding. This, in turn, leads to increased customer retention rates, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced business success our study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in churn prediction , provides insights into the comparative performance of different algorithms and using survival analysis it helps us calculate the expected life time value and cost to be spent in retaining old customers. This can help telecom industries to make informed decisions regarding customer retention and improve their profitability
